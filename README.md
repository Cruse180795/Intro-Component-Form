### > Challenge Objective

The project is a challenge provided by frontend mentor, where you must build a signup form that is responsive for both mobile and desktop viewing but also with correct form validation.

### > How Did I Complete This Project

For this project i was tasked to build a signup form that works on both mobile and desktop screens and has working input validations. I created the layout using a combination of HTML and CSS whilst using Figma as a reference for the intended mobile and desktop designs. I used JavaScript to create the input validations and to display the error messages underneath the input as well as success messages underneath inputs if they met the requirements. I used the following technologies in this project:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. Figma
